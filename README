This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2905

Note:
There is also  http://packages.debian.org/sid/vim-addon-manager
which servers a similar purpose but is Debian specific.
I chose the same name by accident.

usage example:

set runtimepath+=~/path-to/vim-plugin-manager
call scriptmanager#Activate(["vim-haxe","The_NERD_tree","vim-latex"])

On startup you'll be asked for confirmation that vim may install the plugin for you.

How to quickly install a plugin and see whether it does what you want?
:ActivateAddons <c-d>vim-latex
:UninstallNotLoadedAddons vim-latex

This script should be kept as simple as possible.

It's main task is to fetch Vim plugins putting each into its own directory.
Those directories are added to runtimepath for you.
A plugin can depend on other Vim plugins. Those dependencies are fetched as well.

Scripts are updated by running git pull, svn up etc.

I recommend installing this plugin using
git clone git://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager.git
(project page): http://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager

so that it's easier for you keeping it up to date.

Note: I wrote this plugin to make your and my life easier.
Help my improving it by sending feedback!

Credits to Tim Pope who sent first patches!

Note: I setup a cron job which updates the 
vim-plugin-manager-known-repositories once a day automatically.
Enjoy!

=======================
This script servers a similar purpose:
http://github.com/c9s/Vimana

vim-addon-manager differs:
* it installs each plugin into it's own directory.
   (I'm sure it's easy to patch Vimana to do the same)
* You can activate / install plugins at runtime as needed using the
    ActivateAddons command
   This is nice because plugins can have optional dependencies which
   are loaded when required only !
* cause it's written in VimL you only need these dependencies:
  - curl
  - git   (recommended)
  - svn (for vim-latex)

Try both tools. Use whatever serves you best!
